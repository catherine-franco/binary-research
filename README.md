# Binary Search Trees
>*In terms of time complexity, to what extent is a Red-Black Tree more algorithmically efficient than an Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree upon the deletion of values?*

## Overview
This research paper investigates the comparative efficiency of Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees in terms of time complexity, with a specific focus on their performance during the deletion of values. Binary Search Trees (BSTs) serve as the foundational data structure, and this study explores how the distinctive characteristics of Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees impact their respective abilities to maintain balance and optimize deletion operations.
